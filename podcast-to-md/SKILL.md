# Podcast to Markdown

Turn podcast episodes into structured Markdown files. Each output file is a self-contained knowledge unit with rich frontmatter, show notes, and timestamped transcript — designed for downstream processing: summarization, search, quote extraction, knowledge graphs.

## Scripts

```bash
# Find a podcast
.agents/skills/podcast-to-md/scripts/search "podcast name or Apple Podcasts URL"

# List episodes with metadata
.agents/skills/podcast-to-md/scripts/episodes <rss_url> [--from YYYY-MM] [--to YYYY-MM] [--recent N] [--all]

# Transcribe audio locally
.agents/skills/podcast-to-md/scripts/transcribe <audio_url_or_file> [--model medium] [--language xx]
```

### search

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--limit N` | Max results (default: 5) |

Accepts a podcast name, Apple Podcasts URL (`podcasts.apple.com/...`), or numeric Apple ID. Returns JSON array.

### episodes

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--from YYYY-MM[-DD]` | Start date (inclusive) |
| `--to YYYY-MM[-DD]` | End date (inclusive) |
| `--recent N` | Last N episodes (default: 10) |
| `--all` | All episodes |

Returns JSON with podcast metadata, episode list, and counts.

### transcribe

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--model SIZE` | Whisper model: tiny, base, small, medium, large-v3 (default: medium) |
| `--language XX` | Language hint (auto-detect if omitted) |

Outputs `[HH:MM:SS] text` per line to stdout. Progress to stderr. First run downloads the model (~1-3GB).

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Each step requires the previous step's output.

### Step 1: Identify the podcast

- If the user gives a podcast name: run `search "name"`
  - If multiple results, present them and ask the user to pick one
  - Show: name, artist, episode count, genre
- If the user gives an Apple Podcasts URL: run `search "URL"` — should return exactly one result
- Confirm the podcast with the user before proceeding

### Step 2: Get episode list

- Run `episodes <rss_url>` with the user's time filter
- Show the user a summary:
  - Number of episodes found
  - Date range
  - Episodes with existing transcript URLs vs. those needing Whisper
- Ask the user to confirm before processing

### Step 3: Process each episode

For each episode, in **chronological order** (oldest first):

**3a. Obtain transcript:**

1. **If `transcript_url` is present:** fetch it with WebFetch or curl. Parse SRT/VTT into `[HH:MM:SS] text` format (see parsing instructions below). Record source as `rss-transcript`.
2. **If no transcript URL:** run `transcribe <audio_url>`. Record source as `whisper`.

**3b. Render the episode .md file:**

Write the file with this exact structure:

```
---
title: "EP42: Title Here"
podcast: "Podcast Name"
date: 2024-03-15
duration: "01:23:45"
season: 2
episode: 42
explicit: false
source: rss-transcript
audio_url: "https://..."
episode_url: "https://..."
artwork_url: "https://..."
categories:
  - Technology
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
guests: []
---

## Show Notes

[RSS description content — convert HTML to Markdown]

## Transcript

[00:00:00] First segment text here.
[00:00:05] Second segment text here.

## Links

- [Link text](URL) — extracted from show notes HTML
```

**Frontmatter rules:**
- Omit fields that are null/empty (don't include `season: null`)
- `source` must be one of: `rss-transcript`, `whisper`
- `date` format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `duration` format: HH:MM:SS
- `guests`: empty array by default; populate if mentioned in show notes

**3c. File naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` where slug is the title lowercased, spaces to hyphens, non-alphanumeric stripped, max 60 chars.

**3d. Output directory:** `./podcast-transcripts/<podcast-slug>/` unless user specifies otherwise.

### Step 4: Generate index.md

After all episodes are processed, create `index.md` in the output directory:

```
---
type: podcast-index
podcast: "Podcast Name"
artist: "Artist Name"
language: zh
categories:
  - Technology
episode_count: 15
date_range:
  from: 2024-01-15
  to: 2024-06-20
total_duration: "18:45:30"
generated: 2026-04-07
sources:
  rss-transcript: 2
  whisper: 13
---

# Podcast Name — Transcript Index

| # | Date | Title | Duration | Source | File |
|---|------|-------|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | 2024-01-15 | Episode Title | 01:23:45 | whisper | [link](./2024-01-15-episode-title.md) |

## Statistics

- Total episodes: 15
- Total duration: 18h 45m 30s
- Transcript sources: 2 RSS, 13 Whisper
- Date range: 2024-01-15 to 2024-06-20
```

**Index frontmatter rules:**
- `total_duration`: sum all episode durations, format as HH:MM:SS
- `generated`: today's date
- `sources`: count per source type

### Step 5: Report completion

Summarize:
- Episodes processed: N
- Transcript sources breakdown: N RSS, N Whisper
- Output directory path
- Any failures or skipped episodes

## SRT/VTT Parsing Instructions

When fetching an existing transcript via `transcript_url`, convert to `[HH:MM:SS] text` format:

**SRT format:**
```
1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,500
First subtitle line.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Second subtitle line.
```

Parse: take the start timestamp from each entry, truncate to `HH:MM:SS` (drop milliseconds), pair with the text. Skip numeric sequence lines and blank lines.

**VTT format:**
```
WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.500
First subtitle line.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Second subtitle line.
```

Parse: same as SRT but skip the `WEBVTT` header line. Timestamps use `.` instead of `,` for milliseconds.

**JSON transcript format:** structure varies; extract `text` and `start`/`startTime` fields, convert seconds to `[HH:MM:SS]`.

## Error Handling

- **Network errors:** Retry once, then skip the episode and note the failure
- **Whisper model download:** Inform the user on first run (model is ~1-3GB), ask to proceed
- **Transcript parse errors:** Fall back to Whisper, report the fallback
- **Empty/unavailable audio:** Skip, note in index
- **Rate limiting:** Pause and retry

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- For local transcription: a machine capable of running faster-whisper (CPU works, GPU is faster)
